Data Visualisation challenge

This assignment requires generating summary statistics and visualisation using bar charts, pie charts, line graph, box plots and scatter plots.
Finally calculated the correlation and regression.

Summary Analysis:
- From the bar graph we can see that the Capomulin treatment has the most number of observed timepoints and the Ceftamin has the lowest.
- From the pie chart we see that the male mice are 51% vs the female mice 49%.
- The drug infubinol has an outlier.
- As seen from the scatter plot, the correlation coefficient of mouse weight and average tumor volume is positive (0.84) which means that as the weight of the mouse increases, the average tumor volume also increases.
- As seen from the line graph of a single mouse with mouse ID 'b128', the tumor volume has decreased over time with Capomulin drug treatment.
